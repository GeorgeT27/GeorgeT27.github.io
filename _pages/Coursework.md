## MIT Machine learning for inverse graphic
The following notes is my personal understanding of the inverse graphic course. I have summarised all the topics that professor Vincent Sitzmann has covered. 

**The topic which have been covered is the following:**
1. Computer vision & computer graphics fundamentals (pinhole camera model, camera pose, projective geometry, light fields, multi-view geometry).
2. Volumetric scene representations for deep learning: Neural fields & voxel grids.
3. Differentiable rendering in 3D representations and light fields.
4. Inference algorithms for deep-learning based 3D reconstruction: convolutional neural networks, auto-decoding.
5. Basics of geometric deep learning: Representation theory, groups, group actions, equivariance, equivariant neural network architectures.
6. Self-supervised learning of scene representations via 3D-aware auto-encoding.
7. Applications of neural scene representations in graphics, robotics, vision, and scientific discovery.
