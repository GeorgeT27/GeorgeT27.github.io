I'm a third-year Mathematics student at UCL, specializing in machine learning, with a strong passion for generative models such as VAE and diffusion models. While these models naturally lead to computer vision, my particular interest lies in delving deeper into the statistical aspects of machine learning. Through relevant mathematics modules, I've been building a solid foundation to support my focus on both theory and application, enabling me to explore complex challenges in the field, including 3D scene generation, reminiscent of SDXL but in a 3D context.

In my third year study at UCL, I have taken the following course which will potentially help my research later on. 
1. Machine learning for domain specialist
2. Statistical machine learning
3. Stochastic process
4. Advanced stochastic modelling
5. Applied stochastic modelling
6. Functional anlysis

More specifically, the course 'Machine Learning for Domain Specialist' will acquaint me with several traditional supervised learning techniques, including bagging and boosting. In 'Statistical Machine Learning,' I'll be introduced to fundamental Bayesian learning principles, including the EM algorithm, its derivative Kalman filtering and Baum-Welch on latent time series, and diverse variational inference methods, like mean-field approximation. Meanwhile, 'Functional Analysis' will equip me with the essential mathematical understanding necessary for an in-depth exploration of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, which are an advancement of kernel methods that facilitate various applications in statistical machine learning.
