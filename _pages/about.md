I'm a third-year Mathematics student at UCL, specializing in machine learning, with a strong passion for the theory behind generative models such as VAE and diffusion models. In particular, I am interested in integrating diffusion model into functional space. While these models naturally lead to computer vision, I've been building a solid foundation to support my focus on both theory and application, enabling me to explore complex challenges in the field, including 3D scene generation, reminiscent of SDXL but in a 3D context. 

Beside 3D image generation, I have a keen interest in neuroscience and wish to explore the intricacies of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to better understand brain activity. My goal is to start at institutions like the Gatsby Institute. I'm also drawn to the groundbreaking work in neural imaging by Stability AI, especially their "Mind's Eye" project. 

In my third year study at UCL, I have taken the following course which will potentially help my research later on. 
1. Machine learning for domain specialist
2. Statistical machine learning
3. Stochastic process
4. Advanced stochastic modelling
5. Applied stochastic modelling
6. Functional analysis
