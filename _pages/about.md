I am a 3rd-year Mathematics student at UCL, with a primary focus on financial mathematics. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, accounting and quantitative finance. I have had the opportunity to delve into various aspects of financial mathematics, including risk management, portfolio optimization, and derivative pricing. Through projects and coursework, I have honed my skills in data analysis, programming, and financial modeling using tools such as Python. Furthermore, I am interested in specialisation in digital automation. I am currently working in Schneider electric as an intern. This summer I have also worked at credit management department in China Merchants Bank.
